      Community-Enabled Analytics (CEA) is proposed as a solution to develop a community of nearly 500 individuals that attack analytic challenges in real time for Sushi. 
      The program is designed to drive on-demand data needs - as well as customer acquisition, ecosystem growth and token circulation.
